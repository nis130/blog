### Talk at GUADEC 2021

I got a chance to give a small 3 minute presentation about my GSoC project at GUADEC'21.
It was an amazing experience. Due to time constrains, I gave an overview of my goals and their progress. Special thanks to [felipe borges]() for seemless execution of the presentation.
Got to learn many new things from the event.

Hope to see you all in person some day.
